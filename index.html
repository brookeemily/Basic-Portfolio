        <p id="bio"> Hi! My name is Brooke.
            <br>
            <br> I graduated from Penn State University with my Bachelor of Design in the spring of 2018. I was a part of the
            Interdisciplinary Digital Studio program at Penn State. While in the program I was able to learn all about digital
            design - I worked on projects of all kinds from 2D design, 3D design, interactive design, photography / photo
            editing, videography / video editing, physical computing, and game design.
            <br>
            <br> After graduation, I decided to pursue web development to build off of my current skillset as a digital designer. I've always loved exploring new ways to create things and I'm so excited to be jumping into web development! I currently work at Chipotle to make a few dollars on the side. When I'm not coding or rolling burritos, you can probably find me playing guitar, online shopping, playing video games, or binge watching some weird YouTube videos. </p> <br>
